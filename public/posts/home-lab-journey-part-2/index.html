  <div class="post-content"><p>There I was, staring at a tangled mess of Ethernet cables, jacks, and tools, completely clueless about where to start. It was a humbling moment, and honestly, a bit frustrating. What seemed like a straightforward plan to set up a home network from my living room to the attic had quickly turned into a chaotic reality. But it was all part of the process, and I was about to learn way more than I ever imagined ‚Äî from crimping cables and wiring standards to discovering that routers are often full of surprises.</p>
<h2 id="a-trip-to-the-store-the-first-challenge">A Trip to the Store: The First Challenge<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-trip-to-the-store-the-first-challenge">#</a></h2>
<p>With my living room full of gadgets and a workroom upstairs, I knew I had to run an Ethernet cable from the ground floor up to the attic, where my newly bought switch would handle all the connections. Easy enough, right? So I went to a few local electronics stores, expecting to grab a long enough cable and be on my way.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs when I hit my first roadblock. The shops didn‚Äôt have any pre-made cables long enough for my needs. I was stuck. But then, I spotted these D-Link Cat6 cables on the shelf‚Äîonly catch? They weren‚Äôt terminated. They needed to be crimped.</p>
<p>Now, up until this point, ‚Äúcrimping‚Äù was just a word I‚Äôd heard in passing. I knew it involved pressing wires into connectors, but that was about it. Little did I know, this would soon become my initiation into the world of Ethernet wiring. With no other option, I grabbed the D-Link cables, some RJ45 jacks, and a crimping tool kit. It was time to dive into the deep end.</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-cable-types-cat5e-vs-cat6">Enter the Cable Types: Cat5e vs. Cat6<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#enter-the-cable-types-cat5e-vs-cat6">#</a></h2>
<p>While at the store, I also learned something important: not all Ethernet cables are the same. The shop assistant mentioned Cat5e and Cat6, and to be honest, I had no idea what the difference was. So, like any self-respecting techie, I Googled it right there in the store.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the short version: both Cat5e and Cat6 can handle speeds up to 1 Gbps, which is more than enough for most home networks. But Cat6 offers a bit more, like support for 10 Gbps speeds and better performance over longer distances‚Äîperfect if you‚Äôre future-proofing your setup. Since I didn‚Äôt want to run cables again anytime soon (trust me, it‚Äôs a pain you don‚Äôt want to experience twice), I went with Cat6. And if you‚Äôre running your cables through walls or attics, like me, outdoor-rated cables are a smart choice, especially if they‚Äôre exposed to the elements. In my case, they weren‚Äôt, but I tucked that tip away for later projects.</p>
<h2 id="crimping-a-new-skill">Crimping: A New Skill<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#crimping-a-new-skill">#</a></h2>
<p>So now, armed with my cables, RJ45 jacks, and crimping tools, I was ready to make this work. The first problem? I had no clue how to crimp a cable. I remember sitting there, staring at the kit like it was some kind of alien technology. Luckily, Google and YouTube came to the rescue.</p>
<p>It turns out, when crimping Ethernet cables, you have to follow specific wiring standards: <strong>T568A</strong> and <strong>T568B</strong>. Both work just fine, but the wiring has to be consistent on both ends of the cable. Most people go with T568B, but for some reason, I decided to use T568A, thinking it wouldn‚Äôt really matter. (Spoiler: It did.)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>T568A Color Code

</code></pre><p>I crimped my first cable, feeling pretty proud of myself. Then I plugged it into my TP-Link TL-SG105E switch in the attic, expecting a blazing-fast connection. What did I get? A measly 100 Mbps. I checked the network cable tester (thank goodness I bought that!), and everything seemed wired correctly. But when I looked at the switch‚Äôs lights, it showed the connection was negotiating at 100 Mbps, not the 1 Gbps I wanted.</p>
<p>Cue more Googling.</p>
<p>It turns out, for some reason, using <strong>T568A</strong> wasn‚Äôt cutting it. Frustrated but undeterred, I crimped a new cable using <strong>T568B</strong>, plugged it in, and&hellip; bingo! Full 1 Gbps. Lesson learned: I‚Äôm sticking with <strong>T568B</strong> from now on.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-cable-from-living-room-to-attic">Running the Cable: From Living Room to Attic<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#running-the-cable-from-living-room-to-attic">#</a></h2>
<p>Once the crimping drama was behind me, it was time to tackle the next big job: actually running the cable from the living room, through the walls, and up to the attic. Now, if you‚Äôve never run cables through a house, let me tell you‚Äîit‚Äôs a workout. There‚Äôs a lot of crawling through tight spaces, fishing cables through tiny holes, and a lot of patience involved.</p>
<p>I managed to get the cable from the living room, through the floorboards, and up into the attic where my 5-port switch was waiting. From there, I branched out connections to my workroom and other parts of the house, creating a stable, wired network. It felt like a huge victory‚Äîuntil I hit the next snag.</p>
<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-an-ethernet-cable-8-wires-1-mission">The Anatomy of an Ethernet Cable: 8 Wires, 1 Mission<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-anatomy-of-an-ethernet-cable-8-wires-1-mission">#</a></h2>
<p>Before I go any further, let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs actually inside these Ethernet cables. Every Ethernet cable has 8 individual wires, each wrapped in pairs. These pairs are color-coded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orange and white-orange</li>
<li>Green and white-green</li>
<li>Blue and white-blue</li>
<li>Brown and white-brown</li>
</ul>
<p>Each pair has a role to play. Ethernet cables use twisted pairs to reduce interference and allow data to travel over long distances without loss of signal. In a standard <strong>T568B</strong> setup (the one I stuck with), the wires are connected in a specific order inside the RJ45 connector, and only two pairs (four wires) are actually used for 100 Mbps speeds. But when you‚Äôre going for gigabit speeds like I was, all four pairs (eight wires) are used to send and receive data simultaneously.</p>
<p>If the wires aren‚Äôt crimped correctly or if the pairs get mixed up, you‚Äôll lose speed or worse, get no connection at all. That‚Äôs where the cable tester comes in handy.

<h2 id="how-the-cable-tester-saved-my-sanity">How the Cable Tester Saved My Sanity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-the-cable-tester-saved-my-sanity">#</a></h2>
<p>Now, the network cable tester is one of those tools you don‚Äôt realize you need until you‚Äôre halfway through a project and something isn‚Äôt working. It‚Äôs a simple device with two ends: one you connect to one side of the cable, and the other to the opposite end. Once connected, it runs a signal through the wires and lights up 8 LEDs‚Äîone for each wire in the cable.</p>
<p>If the lights blink in order, from 1 to 8, your cable is good to go. But if any of the LEDs don‚Äôt light up, or if they blink out of order, it means there‚Äôs a problem with one of the wires. This saved me a lot of guesswork and helped me quickly identify when I had made a crimping mistake. Let‚Äôs just say that happened more than once.</p>

<h2 id="a-speed-bottleneck-in-disguise">A Speed Bottleneck in Disguise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-speed-bottleneck-in-disguise">#</a></h2>
<p>So, after running the cable to my workroom, I grabbed my trusty old Archer C60 AC1350 router to act as a wireless access point. I plugged it into the Ethernet cable, fired it up, and tested the speed. Once again, I was hitting a wall. I wasn‚Äôt getting the full 500 Mbps over Wi-Fi. Instead, the speeds were capped at 100 Mbps.</p>
<p>This one puzzled me for a while, until I checked the router‚Äôs specs more carefully. While the Archer C60 supports Wi-Fi speeds of 867 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, its Ethernet ports were only rated for 100 Mbps. In other words, my fast Internet was getting bottlenecked by the router‚Äôs slow Ethernet ports.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/homelab-part2-d5.drawio.png" alt="Archer AX23 router next to the old Archer C60"  />
</p>
<p>Back to the store I went, this time picking up a TP-Link Archer AX23 AX1800 router. With gigabit Ethernet ports, I finally saw the speeds I was expecting. Another lesson learned: always check both the Wi-Fi speeds and Ethernet port speeds before assuming your router can handle a high-speed connection.</p>
<h2 id="tools-and-devices-i-used">Tools and Devices I Used<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tools-and-devices-i-used">#</a></h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs a quick list of the tools and devices that helped me survive this phase of the home lab build:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>D-Link Cat6 Cable</strong>: For high-speed, future-proof connections.</li>
<li><strong>RJ45 Crimping Tool Kit</strong>: Essential for terminating Ethernet cables.</li>
<li><strong>Network Cable Tester</strong>: A lifesaver when debugging connections.</li>
<li><strong>TP-Link TL-SG105E 5-Port Switch</strong>: My central hub in the attic for all wired connections.</li>
<li><strong>TP-Link Archer AX23 AX1800 Router</strong>: Finally delivered the Wi-Fi speeds I was expecting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-i-learned">#</a></h2>
<p>This phase of my home lab taught me several valuable lessons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crimping is a delicate process. If you don‚Äôt wire things just right, you‚Äôll end up with slow speeds or no connection at all.</li>
<li>Not all routers are equal. The specs on the Ethernet ports matter just as much as the Wi-Fi speeds, especially if your Internet connection is over 100 Mbps.</li>
<li>Wiring standards matter. While <strong>T568A</strong> and <strong>T568B</strong> both technically work, sometimes sticking with the more common standard (<strong>T568B</strong>) saves you a lot of headaches.</li>
<li>Cable running is hard work. It‚Äôs physically demanding and requires patience, but it‚Äôs worth it when everything comes together.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately,  I don‚Äôt have a dedicated photo from this phase of the project, but I do have another shot where you can see the setup in the background. You‚Äôll notice the switch is wall-mounted, and, well‚Ä¶ my cable management is pretty messy. I know the whole setup looks ugly! &#x1f605;

<p>Looking back, setting up the physical infrastructure for my home lab was more challenging than I expected, but it was definitely worth it. Now, I‚Äôve got a fast, reliable network in place, ready to handle the projects I have in mind. In the next post, I‚Äôll be diving into the actual home lab setup‚Äîeverything from choosing the right servers to understanding the essential gear I need to get things running smoothly.</p>
